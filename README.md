# PHP Branch

####Setting up
First of all, what you need to do is download this branch and upload the `index.php` and `cookieurls.txt` to your webserver.
Then scrape the urls from your webserver.

Or, if you want to be fancy, you could add `?image` behind your url, and it will output the cookie as an image (yes with the actual headers) instead of just a plain url.
