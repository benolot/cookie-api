#Cookie-api
This is an API that returns a cookie for the user.

#About this branch
->benolot's code ported to python  
how to use at the moment in python (for those who don't have any idea how):  
-put the CookieMod file in the same directory as your program  
-add 'import CookieMod' to the top of your program  
-create a cookie obect by typing 'cookie = CookieMod()' in your program  
-after that use 'cookie.add_cookie([image adress aka img url])' to add cookie images to the database  (In the bots console / discord monitoring channel / etc)
-use 'cookie.cookie()' to get the filepath of a random cookie in the database (This is what code should be ran after the command)

#The Idea behind making this work
Yeah, this isn't a proper api. It just looks like one. Here have a flowchart explaining the process: http://i.imgur.com/kwCudvW.png
