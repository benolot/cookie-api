#Cookie-api
This is an API that returns a cookie for the user.

#erm about this branch
->benolot's code ported to python  
this is programmed around discord    
this is a python module if you dont know how to work with it it's simple  
put this in the same file as your python main file and write (onthe main file):  
"import CookieMod"  
"CookieMod = CookieMod(discord.Client(), [the message object goes here])"  
do "CookieMod.add_cookie(image_url)" to add cookies to the database  
and do "CookieMod.send_cookie()" to have it send the cookie to current discord channel  

like I said this is all programmed specifiacally for discord, I'll work on that later
